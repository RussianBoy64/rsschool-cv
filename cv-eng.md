## **About me**

In September 2021, I first thought about changing my profession. I have always been attracted to information technology, but it was much more difficult to decide on a specialization.

I decided to start with the basics and signed up for [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) which became a good starting point for me and lifted the veil of secrecy over the world of information technology.

On the course, I had to solve many interesting tasks, from writing simple programs such as encrypting messages or determining the difficulty of reading text written on “C” language, and ending with writing an application that simulates trading in securities with authorization, working with an external API and database (SQLite), implementation of the BackEnd and FrontEnd parts.

This course kindled in me an unprecedented interest and desire to work and develop in the IT field, and also helped me to clearly define the future vector of my development as a FrontEnd developer.
